<span class="smcap">and</span><br />
J. PRINGLE.</p>
<p>The reader of Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s Life of Borrow will remember
that, three years after the 1854 expedition to North Wales,
George Borrow made a rapid traverse through the south-western
portion of the Principality.&nbsp; The incidents of the former
excursion formed the basis of <i>Wild Wales</i>, but the only
published record of the latter tour is the brief itinerary given
in the <i>Life</i>. <a name="citation160a"></a><a
href="#footnote160a" class="citation">[160a]</a></p>
<p>It so happens that for several years past our professional
duties have taken us into the western regions of South Wales, and
into parts of the counties of Carmarthen and Pembroke traversed
by Borrow in 1857.&nbsp; Not satisfied with the bald outline of
the journal published by Dr. Knapp, one of us wrote to him in
Paris with the request that he would be kind enough to furnish us
with a few details as to the villages passed through, and the
inns where Borrow lodged.&nbsp; To our gratification Dr. Knapp
did far more than we had asked; he sent us a verbatim
transcription from the original note book, accompanied by the
following letter <a name="citation160b"></a><a
href="#footnote160b" class="citation">[160b]</a>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>191 r. de
l&rsquo; Universit&eacute;, Paris.<br />
26 Aug. 1908.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your very
interesting communication of the 1st of Aug. reached me on the
6th.&nbsp; My chests containing Borrow&rsquo;s MSS., Letters and
Note Books, are stored and sealed up, so that they are no longer
readily accessible even to me, in the present state of my health
and impaired strength.&nbsp; Besides, the Note Books are in
pencil, written as he strode along the roads of England and
Wales, very badly, and subsequently much thumbed as he pored over
them in later years.&nbsp; Hence they are very trying to the
eyes, and as mine are giving me much trouble, growing weaker and
weaker, I dreaded to subject them to any fresh tension even with
the powerful lenses I am forced to employ.&nbsp; However, after
much reflection I decided to unscrew the boxes till I came to the
Note Books, from among which I drew forth the little one for
1857.&nbsp; And although it has cost me two weeks to decipher and
write down only ten pages, I feel that the labour is wisely
bestowed if it in any way accomplishes your desire.&nbsp; From
Lampeter into Brecknock hills to Builth I could no longer follow
Borrow.&nbsp; He is full of badly written Welsh, is constantly
losing his way, and the Welsh names of villages, hamlets and
parishes cited are not in Lewis or Lett&rsquo;s County Atlas as
he gives them.&nbsp; Still, if you want the Itinerary or anything
further, please let me know.</p>
<p>I should very much like to meet you, but I travel
little.&nbsp; Last year we were in Norwich three
months&mdash;July 1 to Oct. 1&mdash;for my wife&rsquo;s health,
but we went nowhere, only passing thro&rsquo; London going and
coming.&nbsp; I was glad to learn the <i>date</i> of
Henrietta&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Mr. Murray wrote me of the fact
without mentioning the date.&nbsp; By the way I should like a
picture of Borrow&rsquo;s birthplace at Dumpling Green; I have
the one given in &ldquo;The Sphere&rdquo; but cannot lay my hands
on it.&nbsp; Could I trouble you further for the title of the
best modern Welsh-English Dictionary&mdash;not
Pughe&rsquo;s&mdash;and a Grammar with Exercises, and of whom it
could be ordered.&nbsp; Your letter is very valuable to me and I
prize it greatly.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours very truly,<br />
W. I. KNAPP.</p>
<p><i>T. C. Cantrill</i>, <i>Esq.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>As
neither of us saw any prospect of following Borrow&rsquo;s route
beyond St. David&rsquo;s, we had refrained from troubling Dr.
Knapp for details of that part of the journey.</p>
<p>With Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s transcript in our hands we have
traversed on foot much of Borrow&rsquo;s route, and made personal
enquiries of some of the older inhabitants, and, in some cases,
of descendants of Borrow&rsquo;s informants, in an attempt to
rescue from oblivion some particulars of the places visited and
the characters encountered by Borrow in 1857; and now, since the
Note Book appears to have left Europe for a transatlantic home,
it seems desirable to publish so much of the transcript as is
available, together with our comments.</p>
<p>Apart from the usual Borrovian disregard for accuracy as to
distances, directions, and orthography of place-names, the
journal is remarkably straightforward, and the task of
identifying the un-named localities a light one.&nbsp; In his
passage of Milford Haven, however, it is difficult to follow
Borrow, as we have pointed out.&nbsp; Nor perhaps shall we ever
know now how he got to Laugharne, where the notes commence
abruptly at an un-named inn.&nbsp; Presumably he availed himself
of the railway, which was open at that date and would bring him
to St. Clears, five miles from his starting-point.</p>
<p>One wonders how much the world has lost by Borrow&rsquo;s
neglect to incorporate the experiences of 1857 in a volume
similar to <i>Wild Wales</i>, but there is no doubt that the
impressions he gathered were brought to bear on that work, which
was not published till 1862.</p>
<p>Once again, ten years later, Borrow made an expedition into
Wales, though of this journey the sole evidence appears to be a
note book, among the Borrow MS. scheduled by Dr. Knapp, <a
name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162"
class="citation">[162]</a> of a tour in Western Wales in April,
1867.</p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>The
following is the transcript of the 1857 note book as received
from Dr. Knapp (except that several of his comments, chiefly
orthographical and now superfluous, are dropped); of the
insertions in square brackets, some are Dr. Knapp&rsquo;s, some
are our own; for the notes, we alone are responsible:&mdash;</p>
<p>[August 23rd, Laugharne].&mdash;Sunday morning.&nbsp;
Brilliant day.&nbsp; Paid moderate bill for good
accommodation.&nbsp; The landlady said she hoped she sh&rsquo;ld
see me there again. <a name="citation163a"></a><a
href="#footnote163a" class="citation">[163a]</a>&nbsp; The
bridge.&nbsp; Wooded dell. <a name="citation163b"></a><a
href="#footnote163b" class="citation">[163b]</a>&nbsp; Took the
hill route to Tenby, turning to the left.&nbsp; Beautiful scenery
between the two high wooded banks, road rapidly descending.</p>
<p>The little place, Plasholt. <a name="citation163c"></a><a
href="#footnote163c" class="citation">[163c]</a>&nbsp; The child
of the Church of England whose mother was at church.&nbsp; Soon
found myself on level land and a good road; denes <a
name="citation163d"></a><a href="#footnote163d"
class="citation">[163d]</a> and moory lands between me and the
sea, bounded by high banks of sand.&nbsp; Wooded hills on my
right with here and there a farm house upon them or at their
foot.&nbsp; Dreadful heat&mdash;sought refuge in a meadow with a
high hedge to the road.&nbsp; Pursued my way along the road for
several miles&mdash;beautiful gentleman&rsquo;s seat <a
name="citation163e"></a><a href="#footnote163e"
class="citation">[163e]</a> under the hill at a little way from
the road.&nbsp; Came to a little farm house close by the
road.&nbsp; The woman and cows&mdash;asked for water.&nbsp; The
woman not civil till I had given her a penny.&nbsp; The
Burrows&mdash;rabbits&mdash;view.</p>
<p>Pendeane [Pendine], &ldquo;Head of the Denes&rdquo;.&nbsp; The
man, son of Cornish boatswain.&nbsp; The public house on the
shore <a name="citation163f"></a><a href="#footnote163f"
class="citation">[163f]</a><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>&mdash;company.&nbsp; The kind of
flush farmer <a name="citation164a"></a><a href="#footnote164a"
class="citation">[164a]</a> who had been to Australia and who
said the Chinese got all the pretty girls&mdash;the lone village
on the top of the hill <a name="citation164b"></a><a
href="#footnote164b" class="citation">[164b]</a>&mdash;the
church.&nbsp; The old woman of the Church of England reading her
English Bible by the wayside.&nbsp; Over burning hills.</p>
<p>Marrows [Marros].&nbsp; The English village.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Morgan holds another parish where he preaches in Welsh.&rdquo; <a
name="citation164c"></a><a href="#footnote164c"
class="citation">[164c]</a>&nbsp; Presently very near view of the
sea on my left, seemingly a bay.&nbsp; Coast stretching to the
South&mdash;headlands to the East. <a name="citation164d"></a><a
href="#footnote164d" class="citation">[164d]</a></p>
<p>The English musicians, one of which [<i>sic</i>] was a harper,
by the road side.&nbsp; Noble prospect of bay <a
name="citation164e"></a><a href="#footnote164e"
class="citation">[164e]</a> whilst descending the hill&mdash;the
scene very much like Douglas Bay.</p>
<p>After descending hill, crossed a little foot bridge <a
name="citation164f"></a><a href="#footnote164f"
class="citation">[164f]</a> over a kind of pebble way, <a
name="citation164g"></a><a href="#footnote164g"
class="citation">[164g]</a> then on the sea shore and in
Pembrokeshire.&nbsp; Discourse with men who sat on beach.&nbsp;
Puzzled them by telling them that the name of the bridge, which
it seems had no name, should be Pont y Terfyn.<a
name="citation164h"></a><a href="#footnote164h"
class="citation">[164h]</a>&nbsp; I observed that one of them, a
young man, instantly jotted the words down in a book.&nbsp; They
both spoke Welsh and were out of Carmarthenshire.&nbsp; Presently
left shore and, after ascending and descending a hill or two by a
circuitous route, soaked with perspiration and almost exhausted I
reached Saundersfoot <a name="citation164i"></a><a
href="#footnote164i" class="citation">[164i]</a>&mdash;Picton
Arms. <a name="citation164j"></a><a href="#footnote164j"
class="citation">[164j]</a>&nbsp; Kind good humoured honest woman
who apologized for the <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>indifferent accommodation of the
house, by saying that S. was a country place and that they were
Welsh.</p>
<p>[August] 24th, [Monday].&mdash;Breakfast.&nbsp; Burning
morning.&nbsp; Bathed in the sea beyond the little pier, on sandy
beach with rocks here and there&mdash;water shallow, tide going
out&mdash;waded some way&mdash;then swam&mdash;dived at last in
water between seven and eight foot&mdash;rock and sand at bottom,
deep&mdash;strolled up hill after dressing&mdash;the shaft of
deserted mine.</p>
<p>Saundersfoot is a small straggling place on the bottom and
declivity of a hill&mdash;there is a pier, coal works, and
tramway.&nbsp; There is a great rise and fall of tide here,
sometimes thirty feet.&nbsp; At the end of the headland to the
South-East is a strange rock, which can be reached at low water,
called the Monk&rsquo;s Rock. <a name="citation165a"></a><a
href="#footnote165a" class="citation">[165a]</a>&nbsp; Written on
the pier at Saundersfoot.&nbsp; The coast strikingly resembles
the scenery about Douglas; but Saundersfoot cannot be compared
with Douglas, pier exceedingly rude, very narrow, entrance at N.
into bason quite dry at low tide.&nbsp; High and strong wall to
the East and cliff to the S.</p>
<p>I was very much fatigued from the journey of the previous
day.&nbsp; Laugharne is only 12 miles from S.F. but I shall never
forget the heat of the weather&mdash;it was truly horrible.&nbsp;
The Australian Welshman said that the heat of Australia was
nothing to it.</p>
<p>[August] 25th, [Tuesday].&mdash;After breakfast started from
Saundersfoot after paying bill which was very moderate, the dear
good landlady apologizing for my indifferent accommodation though
it had been excellent.&nbsp; Written at the top of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s Rock, Tenby. <a name="citation165b"></a><a

<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>The
transcript enables us to make a correction in the Itinerary as
given in the <i>Life</i>.&nbsp; Borrow is there said to have
walked, on Sept. 3rd, from Lampeter to Builth.&nbsp; This should
read &ldquo;Lampeter to Llanddewi Brefi.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where he
slept on the night of Sept. 4th we are unfortunately left to
conjecture, for it is just here that Dr. Knapp was overcome by
the difficulties of transcription and by want of access to
large-scale maps, as he admits in his letter.&nbsp; We may,
however, hazard a guess that, unless Borrow got hopelessly out of
his way, he slept on the 4th at Abergwessin, about half-way
between Llanddewi Brefi and Builth.&nbsp; On the 5th he reached
Builth, and on the 6th he accomplished a matter of twenty-eight
miles from Builth to Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross (alluded to in chap.
36 of <i>Wild Wales</i>)&mdash;not a bad day for a man of
fifty-four!&nbsp; Beyond this point, however, all we know is that
on the 17th he was at Shrewsbury, and on Oct. 5th at Leighton,
Uppington and Donnington (all in the neighbourhood of the county
town) looking up traces of Goronwy Owen.</p>
<p>And so we leave him.&nbsp; Some day, perhaps, some enthusiast
will publish a transcript of the remainder of Borrow&rsquo;s Note
Book of 1857, and also, perhaps, that of 1867, when we may have a
further opportunity of following still more closely the tracks of
Lavengro across the heart of wildest Wales.</p>

<p><a name="footnote163a"></a><a href="#citation163a"
class="footnote">[163a]</a>&nbsp; It is difficult to locate the
Inn at Laugharne, but from the numerous enquiries we made, it is
possible it was the house kept by a Mrs. Brown, and still known
as Brown&rsquo;s Hotel.</p>
<p><a name="footnote163b"></a><a href="#citation163b"
class="footnote">[163b]</a>&nbsp; The bridge and wooded
dell.&nbsp; The latter divides the town into two halves.</p>
<p><a name="footnote163c"></a><a href="#citation163c"
class="footnote">[163c]</a>&nbsp; Plashett.</p>
<p><a name="footnote163d"></a><a href="#citation163d"
class="footnote">[163d]</a>&nbsp; Dene or Dean.&mdash;Borrow was
doubtless well acquainted with this word in the place-names North
Denes and South Denes, at Yarmouth, where the term is applied to
the sandy waste flats north and south of the town.</p>
<p><a name="footnote163e"></a><a href="#citation163e"
class="footnote">[163e]</a>&nbsp; Llanmiloe, the residence of Mr.
Morgan Jones.</p>
<p><a name="footnote163f"></a><a href="#citation163f"
class="footnote">[163f]</a>&nbsp; The Spring Well Inn, kept in
1857 by a man named Saer.</p>
<p><a name="footnote164a"></a><a href="#citation164a"
class="footnote">[164a]</a>&nbsp; Possibly a man named Phillips,
a native of Saundersfoot.</p>
<p><a name="footnote164b"></a><a href="#citation164b"
class="footnote">[164b]</a>&nbsp; The original Pendine, grouped
about the church.&nbsp; The houses near the shore are probably
later additions, in part due to the attractions of Pendine as a
summer-resort.</p>
<p><a name="footnote164c"></a><a href="#citation164c"
class="footnote">[164c]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Morgan&rsquo;s other parish
was Cyffic, near Whitland.</p>
<p><a name="footnote164d"></a><a href="#citation164d"
class="footnote">[164d]</a>&nbsp; Borrow undoubtedly included the
Island of Caldy as one of the headlands.</p>
<p><a name="footnote164e"></a><a href="#citation164e"
class="footnote">[164e]</a>&nbsp; Saundersfoot Bay.&mdash;Borrow
makes several allusions to Douglas.&nbsp; He stayed there in
1855.&nbsp; The scene in descending the hill from Marros to the
shore at Amroth is indeed a noble one, and for picturesque beauty
and charm of colour the view can have few equals.</p>
<p><a name="footnote164f"></a><a href="#citation164f"
class="footnote">[164f]</a>&nbsp; Now superseded by a
cart-bridge.</p>
<p><a name="footnote164g"></a><a href="#citation164g"
class="footnote">[164g]</a>&nbsp; A storm-beach.</p>
<p><a name="footnote164h"></a><a href="#citation164h"
class="footnote">[164h]</a>&nbsp; Pont-y-terfyn: the bridge of
the boundary.&nbsp; The little stream crossed by the bridge
divides Carmarthenshire from Pembrokeshire.</p>
<p><a name="footnote164i"></a><a href="#citation164i"
class="footnote">[164i]</a>&nbsp; Borrow does not mention
Amroth.&nbsp; Possibly the omission was due to the state of the
tide which, if near high-water, would keep him close up to the
storm-beach, and so curtail his view.&nbsp; This is corroborated
by the fact that he proceeded to Saundersfoot by road.&nbsp; Had
he been able to walk along the shore, he would have materially
shortened his journey.</p>
<p><a name="footnote164j"></a><a href="#citation164j"
class="footnote">[164j]</a>&nbsp; Picton Castle Hotel, kept in
1857 by a Mrs. Rees.&nbsp; The Inn is now named Hean Castle
Hotel.</p>
<p><a name="footnote165a"></a><a href="#citation165a"
class="footnote">[165a]</a>&nbsp; Monkstone.</p>
<p><a name="footnote165b"></a><a href="#citation165b"
class="footnote">[165b]</a>&nbsp; St. Catherine&rsquo;s
Rock.&nbsp; Borrow evidently confused this with St.
Margaret&rsquo;s Island, off Caldy Island.&nbsp; The fort which
now occupies the top of St. Catherine&rsquo;s Rock was not built
till 1868.</p>
<p><a name="footnote166a"></a><a href="#citation166a"
class="footnote">[166a]</a>&nbsp; Presumably Manorbier
parish.&nbsp; We have not identified the &ldquo;half-way
house&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a name="footnote166b"></a><a href="#citation166b"
class="footnote">[166b]</a>&nbsp; Lamphey.&mdash;Borrow probably
thought the name to be a corruption of Llanfair (St.
Mary&rsquo;s).&nbsp; The name is a corruption of Llanffydd (St.
Faith&rsquo;s).</p>
<p><a name="footnote166c"></a><a href="#citation166c"
class="footnote">[166c]</a>&nbsp; The proprietor of the Lion Inn
in 1857 was a Mr. Jones.&nbsp; There is no record of
Borrow&rsquo;s visit, nor is there at the lodge of Pembroke
Castle.</p>
<p><a name="footnote166d"></a><a href="#citation166d"
class="footnote">[166d]</a>&nbsp; Pater battery (pronounced
&ldquo;Patter&rdquo;), near Pembroke Dock.&nbsp; Borrow appears
to have crossed Milford Haven by boat (probably from Hobb&rsquo;s
Point) to Neyland, and to have set out on foot <i>via</i>
Llanstadwell for Milford; but whether he got as far as Milford
that day is doubtful.</p>
<p><a name="footnote166e"></a><a href="#citation166e"
class="footnote">[166e]</a>&nbsp; This is ambiguous.&nbsp; Dr.
Knapp, in his transcript, suggests in an insertion that Borrow
returned to Milford.&nbsp; But there is no evidence that he
reached Milford on the 25th, and on studying the notes we
conclude that he retraced his steps to Pembroke, and stayed that
night (Aug. 25th) at The Lion.&nbsp; Unfortunately there is no
record of his visit left at Pembroke.&nbsp; Next day (the 26th)
he probably crossed from Hobb&rsquo;s Point direct to Milford,
though he does not say so.</p>
<p><a name="footnote166f"></a><a href="#citation166f"

Milford and Haverfordwest.</p>

<p><a name="footnote167c"></a><a href="#citation167c"
class="footnote">[167c]</a>&nbsp; River Daucleddau.&nbsp; The
river at Haverfordwest is the Western Cleddau; it joins the
Eastern Cleddau about six miles below the town.&nbsp; Both rivers
then become known as Daucleddau or the two Cleddaus.</p>
<p><a name="footnote167d"></a><a href="#citation167d"
class="footnote">[167d]</a>&nbsp; Borrow means Milford Haven; the

<p><a name="footnote167i"></a><a href="#citation167i"
class="footnote">[167i]</a>&nbsp; Dr. Knapp was unable to
decipher this word.&nbsp; He remarks in a note that the
pencillings are much rubbed and almost illegible.&nbsp; We think,
however, that the word should be Plumstone, a lofty hill which
Borrow would see just before he crossed Pelcomb Bridge.</p>
<p><a name="footnote167j"></a><a href="#citation167j"
class="footnote">[167j]</a>&nbsp; This was a low thatched cottage
on the St. David&rsquo;s road, half-way up Keeston Hill.&nbsp; A
few years ago it was demolished, and a new and more commodious
building known as the Hill Arms erected on its site.</p>
<p><a name="footnote167k"></a><a href="#citation167k"
class="footnote">[167k]</a>&nbsp; The old inn was kept by the
blind woman, whose name was Mrs. Lloyd.&nbsp; Many stories are
related of her wonderful cleverness in managing her business, and
it is said that no customer was ever able to cheat her with a bad
coin.&nbsp; Her blindness was the result of an attack of
small-pox when twelve years of age.</p>

<p><a name="footnote168c"></a><a href="#citation168c"
class="footnote">[168c]</a>&nbsp; Nanny Dallas is a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
